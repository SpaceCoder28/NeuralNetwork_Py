# NeuralNetwork_Py

This is my attempt to build a simple neural network.
This is the continutation of my project from java. 
I used NumPy for matrix functions instead of custom matrix library

I actually don't know Gradient Descent in terms of formula. 
I understand on high level that it is application of chain rule from derivatives in math but i don't know how to tweek the values of weights and biases using backpropagation. So I'll be using it as is for now.
